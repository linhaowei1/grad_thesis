[premises] d>=0, c**2+d>=0, c+2*d-1>=0, -b+c+d=0

[goal] (c**2+d)*(b+2*d-1)>=0

[proof]
/* First, let's rewrite the fourth condition to express b in terms of c and d */

premise [rewrite]: -b + c + d = 0 => b = c + d

/* Now, let's substitute this expression for b in the inequality we want to prove */

goal [b=c+d]: (c**2 + d) * (b + 2*d - 1) >= 0 => (c**2 + d) * (c + d + 2*d - 1) >= 0

/* Simplify the inequality */

goal [rewrite]: (c**2 + d) * (c + d + 2*d - 1) >= 0 => (c**2 + d) * (c + 3*d - 1) >= 0

/* Now, let's analyze the factors of the inequality:
Factor 1: c**2 + d >= 0 (given)
Factor 2: c + 3*d - 1 >= 0
We know that c + 2*d - 1 >= 0 (given). Since d >= 0, adding d to both sides of the inequality will not change the direction of the inequality: */

premise [rewrite]: c + 2*d - 1 >= 0 => c + 3*d - 1 >= d

/* Since d >= 0, we can conclude that c + 3*d - 1 >= 0. */

premise [imply]: c + 3*d - 1 >= d, d >= 0 => c + 3*d - 1 >= 0

/* Now we have both factors being non-negative: 
1. c**2 + d >= 0
2. c + 3*d - 1 >= 0
The product of two non-negative numbers is non-negative. Therefore, (c**2 + d) * (c + 3*d - 1) >= 0, which is equivalent to the inequality we wanted to prove:*/

premise [imply]: c**2 + d >= 0, c + 3*d - 1 >= 0 => (c**2 + d) * (c + 3*d - 1) >= 0

/* we have the same premise and goal, thus the proof is done. */
